# About
This project is an exploration for 3D rendering in web browsers.
More specifically, browsers that support OpenGL based rendering capabilities (WebGl).

Project uses the awesome [BabylonJS library](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) for rendering.
Models used are from [BlendSwap](http://www.blendswap.com/). Textures and environment maps are done via [Gimp](www.gimp.org).
Mesh material uses a rough combination of diffuse, specular and fresnel shader.

### [Play around with live demo](http://codebysd.github.io/webgl_3d_exp/)
You'll need a reputed web browser and a machine with OpenGL support.
