# About
This project is an exploration for 3D rendering in web browsers.
More specifically, browsers that support OpenGL based rendering capabilities (WebGl).

Project uses the awesome [BabylonJS library](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) for rendering.
Mesh material uses a rough combination of diffuse, specular and fresnel shader.
Ground is generated from a heightmap and grass cover is made of procedurally distributed sprites.

### [Play around with live demo](http://codebysd.github.io/webgl_3d_exp/)
You'll need a modern web browser capable of webgl and a machine with decent graphics hardware.

### Build and run
1. Install [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org)
3. Run `npm install` in project root directory.
4. Open `index.html` in web browser.
